Hello is Herbert there thinking.
I'm so glad I got ahold of you. This is Brian Lawson. I'm a paid professional solicitor with info. Scission working with the American Heart Association. I want to. Thank you for all the support you've given to those affected by heart disease and stroke in Pennsylvania and across the country were planning. Our research programs for the year and I simply wanted to ask again we count on.
$25 gift like you've done for us before yes.
Thank you so much for that gift. We really appreciate everyone of AM. Let me just enter that in my system.
And just to confirm you'll be helping out with a generous $25 gift is that correct that's correct.
Thank you so much for that gift now sadly heart disease is the number one cause of death in the world and it is the leading cause of death in the United States as well. So normally I wouldn't ask but could I please have just $6 to your donation today to help us Kentucky no no let's.
Well put your gift to order lifesaving research immediately, which credit or debit card would you like to use the I'll give you a check?
Well, I understand that a lot of people I talked to mention dead rather send in a check, but I should mention that the cost for those letters and envelopes and postage it all adds up and that's money then that we can't use to help fund programs. Pudding well actually I think I have a hard thing here right now.
OK, that's not a problem. I'll just send you out a letter instead can you close her file your first and last name for me? Please Castle CASSELOK? Can you please confirm your full address street city state and zip code?
36 Turner Drive Fayetteville BA 17222, one moment, please great. Thanks again for your generous support. I will send you a thank you. Letter stamp with a bright red telephone. Please use the return envelope and close to ensure your gift gets to a sub.
I also want to let you know a financial statement may be obtained by contacting the American Heart Association at 18024, 28721, have a nice day, bye bye.
